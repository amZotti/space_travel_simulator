Outcome:
Create a program that would allow me to implement design patterns I have learned
from gang of four

Reason:
These design patterns are universal throughout all object oriented programming
languages and highly effective. I need to know them all eventually so I might as
well learn them all right now. 

Reading about them is one thing, but implementing them is different. Once I
implement them I will begin to gain an intuitive understanding of how they work
and will no longer need to think about implementing them. I want these patterns
to become a part of my unconscious resources.

Action:
Create a single player test based game with the following functionality:

1) User can enter different ships
2) User can pilot other ships
3) While a user is piloting a ship, he can increase/decrease speed, set
coordinates, and initiate/cease travel
4) User can land ships on planets
5) User can launch ships from planets into space
